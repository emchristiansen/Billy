This is a framework for testing visual features, eg SIFT, SURF, and BRIEF. It is similar to [VLBenchmarks](http://www.vlfeat.org/benchmarks/index.html) except it is written in Scala and thus automatically superior to anything touching that awful language Matlab.

This project is under development. Stay tuned for documentation.
