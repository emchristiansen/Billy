Named after Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse Five. Currently trying to find the appropriate quote.

This is a framework for testing visual features, eg SIFT, SURF, and BRIEF. It is similar to [VLBenchmarks](http://www.vlfeat.org/benchmarks/index.html) except it is written in Scala, plays well with OpenCV, and can run seamlessly on a desktop or a cluster.

This project is under development. Stay tuned for documentation.
